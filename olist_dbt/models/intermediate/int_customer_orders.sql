-- We are going to create Customer-leel dataset to get churn logic.
-- We are trying to answer Who churned ?, Why they churned? and What their behaviour was?
-- Churn means customer who was previously active, has now been inactive for a defined period = 180 days, and its assumed is unlikely to return.
-- We already created behaviour, delivery and satisfaction predictors in Orders enriched i.e. Order level dataset
-- With this Customer leel dataset view, we can get :-
/*
1.) Customer segmentation
High value vs low value
Fast delivery vs slow delivery
Happy vs unhappy customers

2.) Revenue analysis
Lifetime value (LTV)
Order frequency
Recency

3.) Experience diagnostics
% late deliveries
% low reviews
Average delivery delay

*/

-- ============================================================
-- 1) LOAD BASE ORDER DATA (already enriched at order level)
--    This table has one row per order with delivery metrics,
--    value metrics, review info, etc.
-- ============================================================

with orders as (
    select * from {{ ref('int_orders_enriched') }}
),

-- ============================================================
-- 2) LOAD CUSTOMER DIMENSION
--    We need customer_unique_id because customer_id in Olist
--    is NOT stable — same person can appear multiple times.
-- ============================================================

customers as (
    select
        customer_id,
        customer_unique_id,
        customer_state
    from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
),

-- ============================================================
-- 3) ATTACH CUSTOMER UNIQUE ID TO EACH ORDER
--    This step ensures all orders belonging to the same person
--    are grouped correctly in the final customer-level table.
-- ============================================================

orders_with_unique_id as (
    select
        c.customer_unique_id,
        c.customer_state,
        o.*
    from orders o
    left join customers c
        on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
),

-- ============================================================
-- 4) CUSTOMER-LEVEL AGGREGATION
--    This is the MAIN table.
--    Goal: Summarize each customer's entire lifecycle:
--      - order behaviour
--      - value
--      - delivery experience
--      - satisfaction
--      - recency (for churn calculation)
--      - churn flag (for churn logic)
-- ============================================================
